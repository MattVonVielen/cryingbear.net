Thinking deeply about writing an essay about my distant (Bortner) family.
And the prejudice against them and their ilk. https://reimaginingmigration.org/benjamin-franklin-and-german-immigrants-in-colonial-america/
(Look up "dumb dutch") references.)
Trying to figure out how to write the ideas down, turn them into notes, into something I'll be able to actually use in the future, in the not-now.
One of the sources for the work is a "book" from my mom's family history. I wanted to quote it in the possible essay.
Wanted to save my place when I decided to clear it off my desk. Remembered the obituary bookmark from Dad's funeral. Initially seemed appropriate, so I found it and used it. As soon as I closed the book on it, the image hit me of dad's memory, like the bookmark so much smaller than the larger book. And I remember once - just the once - when he let slip around me his resentment about how much more time we spent visiting mom's family. I remember how incredibly true that felt to me - it felt like we visited her brother's family at least once a year, when I'd only met my cousins on my dad's side a couple times, and it felt like we lived is such different worlds.
I looked at the book, swelling with emotion, and said "I'm sorry Dad; but you didn't really leave me with much choice."

The Roman poet Ennius (239-169 B.C.) once said that he had three souls, because he spoke Latin, Greek, and Oscan. In the same way the person who speaks fluently [Pennsylvania Dutch] and English may be said to have two personalities; he has certain insights and interpretations of life not available to a monoglot.

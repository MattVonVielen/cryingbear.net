## Science
Computer programming is not science. It is seldom (if ever) done scientifically.

If it were, you would recognize one or more parts of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) in your work. I sure don't.

This is not to say that "computer science" does not exist; I don't personally have enough data to assert that either way.  But I can safely say that I've never done it, and you won't be doing it at an average programming job.

(Musing about what scientific programming would look and feel like is an interesting exercise, but I suspect you would have a very difficult time finding customers willing to pay the cost of such a methodology.)

## Math
Computer programming is not math. It very seldom involves or requires anything more complex than basic arithmetic. (And here I include modulus as basic arithmetic since it's just a fancy word for the remainder you get from third-grade long division.) Facility with any math more advanced than basic arithmetic will not be a requirement for most programming jobs.

There may more exceptions to this rule than the others, since abstract algebra is occasionally useful or necessary for certain very specific problem domains. On an average project, this may happen once or twice; it is very rare for this to be the bulk of the work on any project. 

The vast majority of the math involved in an average programming job is the 21st century equivalent of an abacus. We mostly count things; counting is not math. (Personally, I don't think it even qualifies as arithmetic.)

# Engineering

Paraphrasing a quote that's sometimes apocryphally attributed to Mohandas Gandhi:

> "What do you think about Software Engineering?"
>
> "I think it would be a good idea."

Computer programming is not engineering.

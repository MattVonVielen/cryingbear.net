I'd like to tell you a story, one that my mother told me when I was younger about my own birth, one she told
me it was true. But before I do, it's probably worth mentioning that I once told this story (some time after my mother
died) while my father was around, and he vehemently denied that it ever happened. 

---

My parents were married in 1961. My mom wanted to have children, but by '65 or '66 it hadn't happened yet. Doctors were
consulted, and they ran some fertility tests on both my parents. The tests, so the story goes, indicated that both my
parents had fertility problems and the expert advice was that the odds of them conceiving were so low that if they really
wanted to be parents, they needed to consider adoption. With that advice, after a little while they chose to go through
the adoption process and eventually became the parents of a nine-year-old boy.

This isn't his story, though - but maybe some other time.

Then in '66, shortly after the adoption, mom became pregnant. Her doctor confimed it and congratulated her, telling her it
was a miracle, encouraging her to count her blessings because of how unlikely it was. That December, she gave birth to
a baby boy of her own body.

Not his story either; sorry.

My story, you see, begins just under ten years later. By this time, Mom was in her early forties. She'd started
to feel like if she didn't know any better she'd say she was pregnant again. Again she went to a doctor, again some tests
were run, and again she was congratulated at defying the odds. It was time to get ready for another baby!

By this time though, she'd had much more life experience - mostly of the masculine variety. Married with two boys, then
forced to move home to take care of her ailing father in the mid '70s - she'd become fed up with living in what was still
quite definitely a "man's world" while perpetually surrounded by boys of all ages. When she discovered she was pregnant
again she knew it was a little girl. Nobody needed to run any tests. She _needed_ a little
girl to bring just a little balance to her life. She even had the perfect name, plucked from the real-world fairy-tale
princess story that was such big news when she was a teenager in the early '50s.

The baby growing inside her was Elizabeth.

In early June of '76, she went into labor, and it wasn't easy. It dragged on for a very long time. (Yes folks, I was even
late to my own birth.) Eventually hospital staff decided on a Caesarean procedure and Mom was given some pretty serious
pain relief. The way she described it to me, I think the phrase "recreationally serious" might be appropriate.

Fast-forward: it's mid-procedure, the baby's safely extracted and the cord is cut. After a once-over to ensure that there
were no emergency issues, a nurse presents Mom with her new child. And Mom, high as a kite (and maybe twice as
desperate) cuddles the baby and coos "Elizabeth..."

Around which time Dad gently reaches down and touches her, admonshing her. "No, Joanne. It's a boy."

"Uh-huh... I love you, Elizabeth... Yes I do..."

So there's my story, as my Mom told it to me anyway; for the first five minutes of my life, my name was Elizabeth.

Except of course, my father insisted that no such thing ever happened.

Thing is folks, all the best made-up stories I know have some kernel of truth at their core. So maybe Dad was right, and
it's simply not true. Or maybe Mom felt like she had to exaggerate things and tell a silly, absurd, and funny story that
didn't quite actually happen as a way to try to explain a dead-serious feeling that definitely did happen. Something she
couldn't really talk about while being serious. A soul-crushing disappointment that no parent could ever try to explain
to their child in honest terms, because of the terrible damage it might cause.

But here's another thing: much as parents don't always see it, sometimes, deep down, their kids just _know_.

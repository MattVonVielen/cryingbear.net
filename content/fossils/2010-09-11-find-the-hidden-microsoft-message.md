After rebuilding my Windows 7 VM from scratch, I (of course) installed
the latest Visual Studio 2010. The first time I ran it, it prompted me
to choose my default settings. This is nothing new - Visual Studio has
had this dialog for as many versions as I remember. The difference is,
this time I actually noticed the "flavor text" that they include to
describe the different configurations - I'd never previously paid any
attention to it.  
  
First, I saw the description for my default choice, C\#:

Then I decided to compare notes with the different configurations. Good
ol' C++:

And the new kid on the block, F\#:

And finally, I wanted to see how the Visual Basic configuration is
described:

I hope I'm not the only one who sees the remarkably heavy-handed
marketing propaganda here - along with the serious implication that C\#,
C++, and F\# developers don't care about building "world-class
applications" - whatever that is supposed to mean!

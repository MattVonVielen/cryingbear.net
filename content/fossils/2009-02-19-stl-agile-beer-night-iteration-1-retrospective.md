Tonight we had [STL Agile Beer Night, Iteration
1](http://stlagile.ning.com/events/stl-agile-beer-night-iteration-1). It
was lightly attended; I can see I'm going to have to work on the finer
points of scheduling for a diverse audience. I think that next time I'll
get some sort of a poll going beforehand with a selection of different
dates to see what draws the most potential attendance.

  

Tonight's beer night consisted of myself, [Brian
Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/), [Zac
Duncan](http://twitter.com/zacduncan) and [Jim
Durtschy](http://twitter.com/jdurtsc). Interestingly, we seemed to stay
"on topic" more than the Iteration 0 crowd, with more discussion related
to development and Agile methodology in particular.

  

My favorite quote from the night (I'm paraphrasing thanks to bad memory
and/or beer comsumption):

  

<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Jim (to
Brian): What would you say is the number one thing that you've seen
companies get wrong when they try to do Agile?  

<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Brian: It's
hard to say, since everybody seems to be doing so many different things
wrong...

For the last month or so, I've been in a largely dark and unhappy mood.
There's been a confluence of events and factors which have led to this
depressive fugue, including (but not limited to):  

-   Self-image; I now weigh more than I ever have in my life, and am
    precariously close to a big, round, psychologically-significant
    number of pounds
-   Money; my credit score is at a precariously low point for someone
    employed by a credit-card processor, and the interest rate on a huge
    and maxed-out unsecured line-of-credit was recently hiked to
    usurious levels
-   Living arrangements; I recently went through a stressful apartment
    move, though I honestly can't point my finger at the stress points
-   Loneliness; being recently divorced, I had physical custody of my
    daughter for most of the summer. The act of returning her to her
    mother, 800+ miles away, knowing I won't spend time with her again
    for the better part of a year, left a surprisingly huge yawning void
    in my life.

  
These and other things conspired to make me quite depressed, and left me
quite discontented with my lot in life, and lately I've been prone to a
lot of really unhelpful "poor me" thinking.But then, reality decided to
rear up on its hind legs and smack me across the face with itself, [like
this](http://wundasworld.blogspot.com/2009/08/wundas-world-upsidedown.html).
It served to remind me that no matter how good of a person you may think
that you are, and how much you may think your life is unfair or crappy,
there's always another good person out there whose situation is
suddenly, devastatingly, life-threateningly **orders of magnitude**
worse-off than yours.  
  
When I first read Wendy's blog entry that's linked to above, on the day
she wrote it nearly a month ago, I felt like I had been gut-punched.
I've never even corresponded with her, much less met her, but I've got a
great deal of respect for her. I'll be the first to admit that the only
reason I even know her name is due to a very intriguing Google Images
result for the query "pair programming", but even though I first came to
her blog because of the photo (seriously, how often does one encounter
really talented female software developers who are *that* hot?), I
definitely stayed for the articles. And when she gave in and finally
started a Twitter account, I was one of her first followers.  
  
So, between the constant noise of dealing with my own life (not to
mention my "poor me" depressive state) and the serious shock of her
announcement leaving me without knowledge of what to say, it's taken me
almost a month to write this. But I suppose the moral of the story (for
*me*, at least) is that Wendy's awful
this-should-never-happen-to-anybody ordeal has started something
positive in the life of a total stranger half a continent away by giving
me a serious kick in my "poor me" complacency. Most, if not all, of the
problems in my life are under my control to one degree or another and
for the most part all I need to do to improve my situation is to choose
to do so, and to persist and persevere. Complacency and a "woe is me"
attitude are my worst enemies; get past them, and I've got a real shot
at making my life better.  
  
Finally, here's a story from my life of which I'm suddenly reminded.
Wendy, if you ever end up reading this, this is for you.  
  
I believe the year was 1977; I don't really remember for sure, since I
was between 6 and 18 months old at the time and I only know the story
second-hand. My mom had been having strange symptoms and been feeling
unwell for some time when her doctor ran some tests and one day gave her
a diagnosis of a disease mom had only barely heard of, and he didn't
want to give her a prognosis without some more work and research. Mom
came home and went next door to talk to a friend who was an RN, and
asked her "What do you know about Lupus?" Her friend's tactless response
was "Not a lot, other than it's always fatal. Why?"  
  
Mom was always a fighter, and refused to let this thing beat her.
Meanwhile, the state of the art changed radically and rapidly, and
nobody would ever say that Lupus is "always fatal" anymore. She did
eventually die - on August 12, 2003, when I was 27 years old, from
complications from type II diabetes. I have decades of happy memories of
her, and the best ones are the looks of incomparable joy on her face as
she played with her granddaughter.  
  
Fight, Wendy. Give your daughter her own decades of happy memories, and
play with your grandchildren.

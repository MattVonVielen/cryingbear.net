But before I do, it&amp;rsquo;s probably worth mentioning that I once told this story (some time after my mother died) while my father was around, and he vehemently denied that it ever happened.
My parents were married in 1961. My mom wanted to have children, but by &amp;lsquo;65 or &amp;lsquo;66 it hadn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet.</description></item></channel></rss>

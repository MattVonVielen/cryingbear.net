One of the questions I always pose to a candidate in this category is “what would you say is the most important effect of practicing TDD?” I have a very particular and narrow set of expected / accepted answers in mind when I ask this, and I’m all too frequently disappointed by the responses I get.

Anybody who follows @bellware on Twitter is almost certainly familiar with his strength of opinion and extreme verbosity on many topics and there are probably some folks who are inclined to take his positions with a proverbial grain of salt. This show however should prove to be pretty easy to swallow even for those folks, and I agreed with pretty much everything I heard there.\nThat said, it’s is a half-hour long interview / discussion on the topic. Something far shorter is in order, especially for a response to an interview question. And although the title - “TDD is Design” - is about as terse as one can get, it’s also unfortunately blunt and doesn’t really cover much in the “why / how” department.\nA little over a year ago, I came across this 5-minute TDD Primer from Microsoft’s ARCast.TV featuring Peter Provost, which does a fairly good job at peeling back the issue to the bare bones. I’ve included the most relevant snippet here:\nIt’s something developers use to kind of enable emergent design. TDD is not about testing […] and that the “T” is really a wrong choice of words in there. And then it’s also not about development and so one of the “D\"s is wrong too. We like to say that it’s “Example Driven Design” - saying what you want before you do it, and then confirming that you got what you expected - and that leads to emergence of design in the small.\n— Peter Provost\nPeter later mentions that TDD has “this amazing side-effect” of producing “really high unit test coverage.” Until then, I’d never considered calling the test coverage a “side-effect” - it seemed almost sacrilegious - but this was a major “Matrix Moment” for me.\nDo not try to cover 100% of your code with tests, for that is impractical. Only try to realize the truth - the tests are a side-effect.\n— That annoying kid from The Matrix (slightly paraphrased)\nAnyway, Peter’s explanation is some pretty good stuff. But it’s still lacking a certain je ne sais quoi. Wouldn’t it be really nice if we had something that was sound-byte-sized and yet still contained the distilled essence of this message? Well it turns out that we do. Also a little over a year ago, I was at a meeting of the St. Louis .NET User Group and the topic of “why do TDD” was raised. Brian Button was in the room and delivered what I still consider to be the end-all, be-all sound-byte-ish answer to this question, and I love it so much that I’m making the text annoyingly large to try to drive the point home:\nThe single most important effect of practicing TDD is that it forces you as the developer to be the first consumer of your own API.\n— Brian Button\nIt’s my firm belief that nearly any developer with more than a little experience knows an annoying or unfortunate API when he/she uses it. How does TDD help you in this regard? Well, in the podcast I mentioned above, Scott Bellware refers to “test friction” and Scott Hanselman refers to “test smells.” One example that was mentioned was the sort of test that requires way too much setup just to exercise a single method (or worse, constructor). If you’re doing TDD, and you catch yourself writing a metric butt-ton of setup or “Arrange” code for an otherwise simple method call, then your instincts should kick in and start sending tiny messages to your conscious mind saying “hey - this API is crap!”\nI will soon write a follow-up to this post with some more concrete examples - there are plenty of products and frameworks out there that make for easy targets, and I’m deliberately not going to discuss Oxite since it’s already been beaten to death.

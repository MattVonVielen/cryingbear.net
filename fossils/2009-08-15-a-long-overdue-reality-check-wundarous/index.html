I’ll be the first to admit that the only reason I even know her name is due to a very intriguing Google Images result for the query “pair programming”, but even though I first came to her blog because of the photo (seriously, how often does one encounter really talented female software developers who are that hot?), I definitely stayed for the articles.

Wendy, if you ever end up reading this, this is for you.\nI believe the year was 1977; I don’t really remember for sure, since I was between 6 and 18 months old at the time and I only know the story second-hand. My mom had been having strange symptoms and been feeling unwell for some time when her doctor ran some tests and one day gave her a diagnosis of a disease mom had only barely heard of, and he didn’t want to give her a prognosis without some more work and research. Mom came home and went next door to talk to a friend who was an RN, and asked her “What do you know about Lupus?” Her friend’s tactless response was “Not a lot, other than it’s always fatal. Why?”\nMom was always a fighter, and refused to let this thing beat her. Meanwhile, the state of the art changed radically and rapidly, and nobody would ever say that Lupus is “always fatal” anymore. She did eventually die - on August 12, 2003, when I was 27 years old, from complications from type II diabetes. I have decades of happy memories of her, and the best ones are the looks of incomparable joy on her face as she played with her granddaughter.\nFight, Wendy. Give your daughter her own decades of happy memories, and play with your grandchildren.\n","wordCount":"797","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2009-08-15T23:17:00-05:00","dateModified":"2009-08-15T23:17:00-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Campbell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://www.cryingbear.net/fossils/2009-08-15-a-long-overdue-reality-check-wundarous/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Crying Bear Studio","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://www.cryingbear.net/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://www.cryingbear.net/ accesskey=h title="Crying Bear Studio (Alt + H)">Crying Bear Studio</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://www.cryingbear.net/articles/ title=Articles><span>Articles</span></a></li><li><a href=http://www.cryingbear.net/fossils/ title=Fossils><span>Fossils</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>A Long Overdue Reality Check (@wundarous)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2009-08-15 23:17:00 -0500 -0500'>August 15, 2009</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Campbell</div></header><div class=post-content><p>For the last month or so, I&rsquo;ve been in a largely dark and unhappy mood.
